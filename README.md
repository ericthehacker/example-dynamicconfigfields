# EW_DynamicConfigFields

This module is a working example of dynamically generated store config fields and config groups.

For each country configured at `General -> General -> State Options -> State is Required for`, a dynamic config field will be added to the parent group.

Additionally, to demonstrate an example of dynamic config groups, for each country configured a dynamic group will be added to the parent tab.

Finally, an example config helper is implemented to retrieve values from these dynamic fields.
